The incline bench position increases the stretch on the long head of the biceps, while the neutral grip increases emphasis on the brachioradialis and brachialis. But the \"hammer\" takes some of the tension away from the long head, negating the benefit you gain from sitting at an incline.  Test this yourself by simply placing your right hand on your left biceps. Move your left hand from palm up to palm sideways and you can feel the tension change in your biceps.",

Hold your arms straight out infront.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>'squat' down leading with your hips as if you are going to sit down on a chair, untill your hip is parallel with or lower then your knees. While doing this you should keep your back straight and your body weight should be towards the back of your feet. Your knees shouldn't should end up behind your toes. If they are in front of them you are not leading the squat with your hips and will have the wrong posture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stand back up and repeat as necessary.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Holding your arms straight out in front of you will help you keep the correct posture through out the exercise. It's also helpful in maintaining posture to choose a point on the wall to focus on.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",
