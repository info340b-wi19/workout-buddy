            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.addrc.org/adhd-numbers-facts-statistics-and-you/">ADHD is a mental disorder</a> that affects 4.4 percent of the US population. As someone who is diagnosed with ADHD, I know how it can negatively impact one’s lives in many aspects. People with ADHD often struggle with organization, attention issues, and restlessness and this can make life challenging. 
                Having gone through childhood with ADHD, I believe the greatest difficulty with ADHD is how much it can be a burden during school. Most people are diagnosed as kids and struggle with issues in school compared to their peers. Even as a young adult in University, I still struggle with attention issues in a world where distractions are easily available. Since most of my assignments in University have been online, I find it easy to waste time online when I want to be doing schoolwork.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>I would like my web application project to be tailored towards users that are students of all ages with ADHD. Currently, there is no web application out there that a student with ADHD can use to help them focus online. I have heard of sites like <a href="https://tomato-timer.com/">tomato timer</a>, which can help users focus by acting as a timer to indicate 25 minute blocks of work time followed by 5 minute breaks. However, for someone with ADHD there needs to be better way to help them focus. Specifically, they need something that can actively assist them in not procrastinating.
                One way to tackle this issue would be a website that one can leave open in the background of their browser. The user would have an option to enable a mode where sites that are commonly used as distractions, such as social media sites, would be blocked. Generally, the app would run in the background, collecting details about the user’s browsing patterns, and provide and log reports of how the user spends time on the internet. If that is not feasible, I also think some sort of interactive game that helps users with ADHD would be something I’d like to do.
